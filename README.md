# mobile-subscriptions

A one page responsive site for mobile subscriptions.

HTML & CSS

## Why
To work off a figma design and create it.

## Notes
I was trying to get the button clicking on each item to be made from one div and then using ::before to style the shadow button behind it. It started to break down when I wanted to move the main button when you click it, so I opted to make two separate elements.

Oh wow, I just realized I could've just used box-shadow on those large boxes. Yea that would've worked just fine and I wouldn't have needed to use position:relative and position:absolute on things!

It would've saved me creating another div on each as well.

As my old boss used to say, "There's more than one way to get to [insert your favorite grocery store here]" So the way I have it works, I'll probably use box-shadow next time though.
